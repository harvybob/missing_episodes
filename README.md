# missing_episodes
Look at kodi mysql database and find all episodes, check against TVDB

Couple of settings needed:
1) provide mysql details to line 29 - host/ip of where mysql is, user, pass, current kodi video schema
2) Set if you wish to see specials - N for No, Y for yes (line 17)
3) Set single show to Y/N - If Yes it will only check one show based on id provided on line 166. - This is really to test
